## DevOps

The DevOps learning path involves mastering key technologies such as Linux, Docker, Git, Ansible, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. Understanding Linux fundamentals provides a strong foundation, while Docker enables containerization for scalable deployments. Git facilitates version control for collaborative development. Ansible automates configuration management, Kubernetes manages container orchestration, and Jenkins automates CI/CD pipelines. Continuous learning and hands-on practice with these tools are essential for mastering DevOps principles and practices.
